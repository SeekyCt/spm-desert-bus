# Super Paper Mario Desert Bus, the mod nobody wanted!
A little mod I threw this together over the past few days for April Fools, a little hacky but it does the job lol.

## Playing
If you're crazy enough to want to play this and see the very good victory screen, see the instructions [here](https://pastebin.com/9R9du92qâ€‹) (estimated to take around an hour to complete?). Only PAL is supported (revision 0 or 1).

## Building
If for some reason you want to compile this yourself, just use 'make eu0' (or make 'eu1', will give the same result) in the `rel` folder.

## Credits
This mod is built using the [SPM Rel Loader](https://github.com/SeekyCt/spm-rel-loader) which is based on the TTYD rel loader by PistonMiner, Zephiles, Jdaster64 and JasperRLZ.
